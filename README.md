# Letterpress Player

Solves Letterpress games via OCR and colour categorization. Work in progress.

# Usage

Take a screenshot of a Letterpress game then launch this app immediately. Wait a few seconds and you'll see all possible words, ordered by score.

# Goals

Right now, this is more of a "cheating" app, but the end goal is to have a fully automated Letterpress player. Items in the To Do List will address that… eventually.

# To Do List

1. Improve performance
2. Refactor
3. Improve UI
4. Improve scoring algorithm to finish a game when a winning word is possible
5. Keep a list of played words
